# RainyDays
![image  ](images/Rainydays.webp)

Rainydays was the first website I made with coding. The assignment was to code the website we made in XD Design using HTML and CSS. Six months after we got to make some changes to the design and add in vanilla JavaScript.   

## Description

The first time we got this assignment the goal was to put into practice everything we learned about HTML and CSS over that course. The brief was to make a website for Rainydays, wich was selling rain jackets. We were supose to keep the HTML neat and try to make it as realistic as we could. I focused on accesability, wcag and getting semantic html.

Later, we made some changes on the site and added JavaScript. We had to install Hotjar and make changes from what feedback we got. We also had to modify the existing Cross-Course Project to fetch products from an external API.    

Under is some of the requirements we had to meet

- Look through your website and assess where API calls need to be made to dynamically add content. You should have a products page and a product details page, but there might be other pages like the home page where products are loaded.
- Remove the hardcoded products from the HTML.
- Add loading indicators when making API calls.
- On the product details page make a request to the API for the specific data for the product that the user has clicked on.
- Ensure proper error handling.
